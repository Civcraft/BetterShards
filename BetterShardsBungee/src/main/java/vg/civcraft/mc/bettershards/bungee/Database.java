/**
 * Thin wrapper around HikariCP datasource / pool.
 * 
 * I recommend a configuration that fits your database needs. If you aren't sure what that looks like, consider the following:
 * 
 * Pool Size of no more then 10; this is the maximum number of concurrent connections that will be alive on the pool. Keep in mind this is limited by the
 *    number of connections the database is configured to support, and exceeding _that_ limit will begin to fail new connection attempts, causing no end of
 *    trouble. Make sure your database instance is properly configured to fit your needs!
 *    
 * Connection Timeout; make this as short as your longest running query. Give some headroom in case of database congestion. 10s is a good value, but 30s may
 *    be more appropriate for database queries that are very slow (big async processes, etc.)
 * 
 * Idle Timeout; Again, this should be paired against your database configuration's idle timeout. If your database drops connections that are idle before your
 *    connection pool does, this can cause your pool to deliver dead connections. That's a bad day. Consider 600 seconds; and configure your database appropriately.
 *    
 * Max Lifetime; Sometimes connections just grow old. It can be useful to just, well, recycle them; throwing away old ones and getting new ones.
 *    Typically you will configure this to be longer then the Idle Timeout. Do not make it overly short. Setting up a connection is expensive and impacts
 *    all other pools attempting to connect to the same database. consider 7200 seconds; well beyond idle timeout, so only well-used connections will last this long.
